            <h3>How Does React Works</h3>
            <p>You may have noticed that the syntax of the HTML code above is similar to XML. That said, instead of using the traditional DOM class, React uses className. <br />
            JSX tags have a name, children, and attributes. Numeric values and expressions must be written inside curly brackets. The quotation marks in JSX attributes represent strings, similarly to JavaScript. <br />
            In most cases, React is written using JSX instead of standard JavaScript to simplify components and keep code clean.</p>
